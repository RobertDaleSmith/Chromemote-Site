Actually it has taken nearly a year for me to accept that the Chromemote development will not continue. It has been an exciting ride and I have learned so much from both building Chromemote and its users. Although I would like to continue make improvements, the time has come. Initially with Google ending support for the plugin that is the backbone of Chromemote, then with the end of the Google TV platform, it just doesn't make sense to continue this project as-is. For these reasons I have decided to sunset the Chromemote project.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout the startup journey that Chromemote took me on, I received no shortage of \"are you crazy\" comments around building anything for the Google TV platform. I had a fate that it wasn't long before every TV would be a smart TV and I was betting on Android. It is nice to see the platform continue on as Android TV, but the differences basically make Chromemote obsolete. I think the remaining feature that could be carried over, would be just simple d-pad controls of a GoogleTV from a Chrome extension. But with the combination of the Google Cast feature on Android TV, it again makes Chromemote obsolete.</p><p><br></p><p>In early 2013, I joined a startup accelerator and began to push my vision of how second screen interaction should work with a new project called Flinger. This project was spawned from the fling feature within Chromemote. After adding this feature to Chromemote, it became obvious to me that discovery and navigation to content should happen on the small screen and the big screen should only be used for watching that content. The whole 10-foot UI idea just isn't always practical. Navigating tedious menus for each individual bits of content with a large keyboard-remote is a pain.</p><p><br></p><p>Just before releasing the initial version of Flinger.co for public beta, a bombshell dropped with the release of the $35 Chromecast. Both Chromemote and Flinger required a $100+ device. The team at Google really hit the nail on the head and must of ran into the same issues and came to similar conclusions as my startup had. It essentially fulfilled my vision for Flinger but implemented at Google scale. We continued development on Flinger.co anyway for about five more months and launched a redesigned version one, but just before I ran out of runway and had to find a job to keep me afloat.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As I have mentioned in previous posts, I landed at Bouncing Pixel doing web development two years back. During my first year there I was able to keep up with updating&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: RobotoLightItalic, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 36px; letter-spacing: 0em;\">Chromemote, but i</span><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0em;\">t has just about been a year since the last update. I know that as Google continues to deprecate old tech that Chromemote is built on, it is only going to continue to break down. I want to be transparent with everyone that has supported this project over the years. I just want everyone to know that development on Chromemote has officially ceased.</span></p><p><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0em;\"><br></span></p><p>The Chromemote users that have shared their support and love for this project are really the rocket fuel that kept it going for as long as it did. I didn't make a living, but I did something I truly loved. Chromemote and Flinger took me across the country. These projects won my brother and I multiple awards. A few ironically from Microsoft, although this being targeted at Google users. The feedback and outreach I received from all the users is what I will remember the most about Chromemote. Whenever I am working on a project at work I don't like, I remember the passion and excitement of my Chromemote users. The greatest part of building a startup, profitable or not, is connecting with real users and making their lives better. Even if it was just to make it easier to change whats on TV.</p><p><br></p><p>--</p><p>I have open sourced every bit of code I developed for Chromemote.

It has been a wild ride over the last two years building Chromemote. The continuous effort to push Chromemote forward took me across the country and taught me many useful lessons along the way.</p>\n<br>\n<p>This all kicked off just over two years ago after a 3DayStartup event. Since then the project led to me getting into two student startup accelerators and winning multiple Imagine Cup awards. Ultimately led to me landing an awesome lead developer position with an interactive design studio called <a href=\"http://bouncingpixel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bouncing Pixel</a>, where I get to spend all day building all kinds of cool stuff including my own apps and startup ideas.</p>\n<br>\n<p>At one point I was crazy enough to think I could work on this project full time and quit my job. Despite many awesome users contributing, I was unable to maintain this as a full time effort. I am still dedicated to committing as much time as possible to keeping the Chromemote effort going, but I will need support from Chromemote's users.</p>\n<br>\n<p>This has been a passion project that I want to continue to thrive. For this reason I have decided to open up the source and to enable anyone to contribute by commiting code. Fix bugs, improve performance, add features, and pretty much anything you want to. Push your code back to the public repo and I will merge your changes into the live version. I know there are many people out there that really love Chromemote and with your help we can keep it going.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n<h1 style=\"font-size:22px;text-align:left;margin:0px;\">The End is Near? : Google TV and NPAPI deprecation</h1>\n<p>Although my grand vision of GoogleTV embedded within every smart TV never really took off, I still really excited of the future of the Android platform on televisions. With the announcment of Android TV, many see this as Google TV's death, but I see it as a rebirth. In this spirit I plan to carry over all the Chromemote efforts to support Android TV devices as well.\n  </p><br>\n<p>Why is the end near you may ask? Well Google has officially ended support for the use of NPAPI plugins within Chrome Extensions. Although we started developing Chromemote all the way back in December 2011, it wasn't until Google I/O 2012 that a NPAPI plugin was released to allow Chrome extensions to communicate with Google TV. Some engineers working on Google TV had seen what I was trying to do, and with their help Chromemote was became a reality. Two years later and the plugin has become incompatible with Chrome.</p>\n<br><p>\n\tSeeing this coming, I built an alternative way of enabling Chromemote to communicate with Google TV devices. This new solution using the Chromemote AnyMote Bridge is less eligant than using the NPAPI plugin because it requires users to install an actual app on the Google TV before it will work. The development of this being rushed and with limited Google TV devices available for testing, it does have some bugs that need to be worked out.\n</p>\n<br><p>\n\tAll of the source code for the Chrome extension and the Google TV bridge app are available on our <a href=\"http://github.com/MoteLabs\" target=\"_blank\">github page</a>. If you want to get involved, then don't hessitate to pull the code and to hit <a href=\"http://twitter.com/RobertDaleSmith\" target=\"_blank\">me up anytime</a>.\n</p>\n<br>\n<h1 style=\"font-size:22px;text-align:left;margin:0px;\">The Future : Android and Android TV</h1>\n<p>I have nearly completed porting the Chromemote experience to an Android app. Because of time restrictions it has been put on hold, but I would love to finish it up if there is actually any demand. So I have set a tip jar goal of $1 for every active user. If I can raise just $1 for every active user, then I will be able to delay any other side projects and focus on finishing Chromemote for Android as well. If this is something you are interested in, then jump over the the <a href=\"http://www.chromemote.com/support-us/\">support-us page</a> to leave a tip in the tip jar.\n  </p><br>\n<p>We are really excited about Android TV and the second screen posibilities that will come along with it. We have already applied to receive an Android TV ADT-1 developer kit. We hope to get as much of a head start as possible with supporting Android TV devices.\n</p><br><p>Code: <a href=\"http://github.com/MoteLabs/\">github.com/MoteLabs</a><br>\nComments: <a href=\"http://www.chromemote.com/support-us/\">chromemote.com/support-us</a>\n</p>\n<style></style>\n\n<script></script>\n\n","live":true}

This is my story of how I discovered the Houston startup community, how it accelerated my entrepreneurial development, and ultimately how it led me to Seattle to hangout with the Startup Weekend <a href=\"http://startupweekend.org/about/core-team/\">core-team</a>.<br><br>\n\nJust a year ago I didn’t even know a startup community existed within Houston. I thought I would have to go somewhere like Silicon Valley in order to be apart of any type of startup culture. Little did I know that there is a vibrant and growing startup community here in Houston with dozens of meet-ups, events, and successful entrepreneurs ready to provide mentorship to local startups.<span id=\"more-493\"></span><br><br>\n\nIt all started during the spring break this last year. My brother and I were pulling an all-nighter working on our latest startup idea(<a href=\"http://www.chromemote.com/\">chromemote.com</a>), when I received an email about an upcoming 3DayStartup event happening at UH. I just knew that I had to submit my idea so I immediately submitted an application. Few weeks later I had an interview and was one of forty students selected to participate.<br><br>\n\nThe 3DayStartup event was an amazing experience where I was able to learn a lot about launching a startup by actually doing it. I pitched my idea and was able to carry it all the way to the final presentations. Through this event I was able to meet some of the key movers and shakers of the Houston startup community. So many from the Houston startup community came out and their mentorship really made the event transformative.<br><br>\n\nInspired and motivated, I pushed forward through the summer break with my idea. By mid July, I had succeeded in developing a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the idea and launched a public beta. Instantly we had thousands of users sending us feedback and using the application every day. Since then we have acquired over 5,800 active weekly users and over hundred users have voluntarily paid for the unfinished beta version.<br><br>\n\nCaptivated by the startup community, I quickly signed up to participate in Startup Weekend Houston in July. During my first startup event I pushed my own idea, so this time I decided to take a different approach and focus on developing someone else’s idea and finding a good team to work with. Once again the experience was truly awesome and the energy of everybody involved is contagious.<br><br>\n\nAfterwards I heard about an opportunity to volunteer to help out with organizing future events. After talking with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/javidjamae\">Javid Jamae</a>, I became involved with helping out with <a href=\"http://houston.startupweekend.org/\">Startup Weekend Houston</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/leanhouston/\">Houston Lean Startup Circle</a>. Through these events and meet-ups I have met so many great individuals that have shared valuable advice and guidance.<br><br>\n\nTowards the end of the summer I had noticed a small photo contest on Startup Weekend’s Facebook page. There were only just a few entries and none of them had actually followed the guidelines. The Startup Weekend Beaker Contest rules were to submit a single photo which contained the Startup Weekend Beaker logo and an inspiring quote to match the photo.<br><br>\n\nI had an idea I thought could win but I procrastinated to act on it until the final day of the contest. The final day I noticed that my idea still may be able to beat the ones posted, so I setup a camera and took the shot of me in front of my workstation. In the photo I had loaded up Startup Weekend logos to show on every screen connected to my laptop and desktop computers. I even wore my Startup Weekend t-shirt I received from the recent Houston event.<br><br>\n\nThe quote I included with my entry was adapted from something that a fellow participant said at the 3DayStartup after party. I really liked his comment and it stuck with me. He told me that 3DayStartup wasn’t just a single weekend for him, but rather he lived 3DayStartup everyday. With minutes to spare I submitted my photo along with the quote, “Startup Weekend isn’t just a weekend, ..I live Startup Weekend!”<br><br>\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2610  alignleft\" alt=\"20121122125749 2012 09 01 06.26.252 300x200 How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\" src=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/20121122125749-2012-09-01_06.26.252-300x200.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" title=\"How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:20px;\">\n\nI received a response from Startup Weekend not long after that stating that I had won the Startup Weekend Beaker Contest and that they showed the photo with the whole office and everybody loved it. I won a weekend stay at the Startup Weekend condo and a chance to visit the Startup Weekend core-team at their main HQ in Seattle. After some excitement I then realized that the prize did not include plane tickets to get there.<br><br>\n\nThe cost of plane tickets on short notice was going to be beyond what I could afford. So I requested to visit SW HQ at a later date so that I could find lower cost tickets and to find some way raise the funds needed. During the November Startup Weekend Houston event I started telling <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fileunderjeff\">Jeff Reichman</a> about my dilemma. He quickly offered to pay a substantial part of the costs if I was able to raise the rest.<br><br>\n\nActing on Jeff’s advice I launched an IndieGoGo campaign, and with the generous help of the Houston Startup community I was able to reach my goal in less than twenty-four hours. Many of the same people that had mentored and inspired me in the beginning, turned out to help make my visit to Startup Weekend HQ possible. Plus many others that simply wish to contribute and give back to the startup community that helped them out as well.<br><br>\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2650 alignright\" alt=\"02 225x300 How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\" src=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/02-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" title=\"How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:20px;\">With the tickets in hand I was able to make it out to Seattle and crossing the Rocky Mountains for the first time.<br><br>\n\nUpon arriving in Seattle I was introduced to a startup called Uber. Thanks to a coupon code I found online I was able to get my first ride from the airport to downtown Seattle for free.<br><br>\n\nThe driver brought me to a building matching the SW address but I was not sure I was in the right place. As soon as I went in, the receptionist knew I was in the wrong place and told me to go around to the back of the building.<br><br>\n\nBeing in a new city I was a little unsure about this, but as soon as I went around to the back I found a large Startup Weekend beaker etched into the ground. I knew I was in the right place. 😁 <br><br>\n\nAs I walked in I circled up a wooden stairway and was immediately greeted by a large whiteboard. The walls were covered with startup related decorations. One of my favorite setups was the Entrepreneur’s Journey.<br><br>\n\n<img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"06 300x225 How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\" src=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/06-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" title=\"How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\" style=\"float:right;padding-left:20px;\">&nbsp;Although I walked into the Startup Weekend HQ in the middle of a busy day, I was warmly welcomed, given a tour, and introduced to all of the Startup Weekend core team members that were working out of the space that day. I quickly realized that Startup Weekend itself is the ultimate startup.<br><br>\n\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/gabepelegrin\">Gabe</a>, SW’s graphic designer, shared some design tips with me for decorating SW social media pages.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thedahv\">David</a>, one of SW’s software engineers, shared his startup story with me about how he left Microsoft to follow his passion which led him to Startup Weekend. He even managed to squeeze in some time at the end of the day to play some old school N64 games with me and to tell me more about what he is developing for Startup Weekend.<br><br>\n\nAfter having lunch with part of the team, I got to sit down with two of the primary founders of Startup Weekend as we know it for a customer development session. On the flight out to Seattle, I read <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarcNager\">Marc Nager</a>’s and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peignoir\">Franck Nouyrigat</a>’s book, “Startup Weekend: How to Take a Company From Concept to Creation in 54 Hours”, so I was really excited to speak with them.<br><br>\n\nMarc invited me to the creative room, which has a wall covered with Startup Weekend t-shirts from events from all over the world. I learned a lot about Startup Weekend from his questions. I discovered that I fit their target customer. Initially I thought the primary customers were the participants but it is actually largely the organizers. The volunteer organizers are both the life blood of the organization but also the largest beneficiaries.<br><br>\n\nBeing social entrepreneurs, Startup Weekend measures it’s performance not in profits but in it’s positive return to society. We are at the very beginning of an entrepreneurial revolution where the barriers of entry are crumbling and making it easier than ever before for entrepreneurs to launch innovative ideas. Startup Weekend’s vision is to spearhead this revolution by facilitating and speeding up the spread of this revolution in entrepreneurship all over the world.<br><br>\n\nI fit the mold of many of the volunteer organizers. I originally participated in a Startup Weekend event, and inspired by the event I volunteered to help co-organize. Becoming involved with your local Startup Weekend not only helps build and spread entrepreneurship in your community but it also allows you to network and connect with like minded people in the startup community.<br><br>\n\nAfter sharing my own perspective and opinions about Startup Weekend. I was able to spend some one on one time with Franck and got his feedback on my own project. Since he has a Google TV he immediately understood what I was working on and gave some great tips for taking my idea forward.<br><br>\n\nAfter spending the entire day hanging out at their office I was even able to get in some time to knock out some actual work I needed to do. Hanging out in their lounge area I found all kinds of interesting distractions.<br><br>\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2664\" alt=\"16 225x300 How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\" src=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/16-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" title=\"How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\">&nbsp;<a href=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/15.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2663\" alt=\"15 225x300 How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\" src=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/15-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" title=\"How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\"></a>&nbsp;<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2660\" alt=\"12 225x300 How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\" src=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/12-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" title=\"How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\">&nbsp;<a href=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/18.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2666\" alt=\"18 225x300 How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\" src=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/18-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" title=\"How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\"></a>&nbsp;<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2662\" alt=\"14 225x300 How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\" src=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/14-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" title=\"How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\">&nbsp;<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2665\" alt=\"17 225x300 How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\" src=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/17-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" title=\"How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\">\n<br><br>\nEnded the work day with some sushi and hearing about all kinds of great startup ideas&nbsp; and things I should go see while in Seattle. I spent the evening having a few drinks with a few of the guys from the office and finding out how they ended up in Seattle working with Startup Weekend. Startup Weekend has both an awesome team and a world changing vision for the future. If I lived in Seattle, then I would be putting in an application for employment at the Startup Weekend HQ.<br><br>\n\nAs apart of the Beaker contest I won a weekend stay at the Startup Weekend condo. Just a short walking distance from the SW HQ, the condo is used by the frequent visitors and volunteers that work make Startup Weekend possible.<br><br>\n\n<a href=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/19.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2667\" alt=\"19 225x300 How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\" src=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/19-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" title=\"How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\"></a> <a href=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/20.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2668\" alt=\"20 225x300 How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\" src=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/startuphouston/20-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" title=\"How the Houston Startup Community Helped Me Go to Startup Weekend HQ\"></a><br><br>\n\nI spent the remainder of the weekend walking all over Seattle and visiting everything I could walk to. I made one last stop into the SW office to donate my SW Houston t-shirt to the wall. I made some meaningful connections, learned quit a bit, and experienced life in Seattle for a few days. This was all possible because of the generous contributors to my <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/startup-weekend-condo-chromemote/x/1744324\">IndieGoGo</a> campaign.

We felt it was time to officially announce the recent changes. Chromemote now has a new logo and a matching website. Thanks to the generous support of graphic designer Alex Smith (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/designalexsmith\" target=\"_blank\">@DesignAlexSmith</a>) for volunteering to make the logo and website.\n</p><p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"tumblr mbxinackDW1r9kc5m Fall Updates &amp; New Logo Announcement \" src=\"https://cdn.rdal.es/images/tumblr_mbxinackDW1r9kc5m.png\" title=\"Fall Updates &amp; New Logo Announcement \"></p>\nWith the new website we have added the ability to install Chromemote directly from Chromemote.com. Also we added a frequently asked questions section where we will&nbsp;continually be updating it with answers to the most common questions.\n<br><br>\nWe have also made several updates to Chromemote itself. First the major change that has been made is with the backend Google TV communication and pairing pairing session. Initially Chromemote had to re-establish a connection every single time the pop-up Chromemote remote was opened.\n<br><br>\nNow we have enabled Chromemote to sustain a connection to a paired Google TV in the background for as long as Chrome is running. This greatly improves connectivity and reduces the pain of having to reconnect every time. Running the communication plugin in the background has enabled the&nbsp;possibility&nbsp;for several new features.<br><br>\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"tumblr mbxjl43o1T1r9kc5m Fall Updates &amp; New Logo Announcement \" src=\"https://cdn.rdal.es/images/tumblr_mbxjl43o1T1r9kc5m.png\" title=\"Fall Updates &amp; New Logo Announcement \"></p><br>\nMany users requested the ability to pin the Chromemote pop-up remote to always stay open, so we made it happen by adding a feature that allows Chromemote to open in a full Chrome pinned tab.\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"tumblr mbxl1fuvld1r9kc5m Fall Updates &amp; New Logo Announcement \" src=\"https://cdn.rdal.es/images/tumblr_mbxl1fuvld1r9kc5m.png\" title=\"Fall Updates &amp; New Logo Announcement \"></p>\nAlso now that Chromemote is connected even when the UI is not active, we have been able to make it so much easier to Fling web content from your computer to your Google TV by adding context menus. Right click on web pages, links, images, and even selected text within Chrome to access the new context menu options included with Chromemote. After right clicking a web link, you can simple click Fling to Google TV to have it instantly load up on your TV.<br><br>\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"tumblr mbxjr82rKW1r9kc5m Fall Updates &amp; New Logo Announcement \" src=\"https://cdn.rdal.es/images/tumblr_mbxjr82rKW1r9kc5m.png\" title=\"Fall Updates &amp; New Logo Announcement \"></p><br>\nWe went ahead and included the settings UI to give users a glimpse of what is to come. These features are currently under development and will be coming in future updates.<br><br>\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"tumblr mbxjxopEGe1r9kc5m Fall Updates &amp; New Logo Announcement \" src=\"https://cdn.rdal.es/images/tumblr_mbxjxopEGe1r9kc5m.png\" title=\"Fall Updates &amp; New Logo Announcement \"></p><br>\nSeveral weeks ago all Mac OSX users that updated Chrome to version 22, experienced issues with Chromemote. This was due to changes within Chrome that basically broke the communication plugin used by Chromemote to pair and communicate with Google TV devices.\n<br><br>\nThankfully with the support of Googler, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160401064431/https://plus.google.com/108944329780009231829/posts\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Hawkey</a> and several emails we were able to solve the problem with Google’s GTV Chrome plugin. We owe Mr. Hawkey big time! <img src=\"http://cdn.rdal.es/images/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\"icon smile Fall Updates &amp; New Logo Announcement \" class=\"wp-smiley\" title=\"Fall Updates &amp; New Logo Announcement \">  If you love Chromemote, then send him your love. Thanks again Dave, you have made many Google TV users very happy!!\n<br><br>\nIn the process of solving this issue, it actually solved a larger issue that many users were having. Chromemote is now compatible with more than just the stable version. It now is working with the beta, developer, and canary builds as well. Also now working correctly with builds of Chromium.\n<br><br>\nIt was also discovered that the plugin for Linux is only compatible with Ubuntu 12. I am working with Mr. Hawkey to broaden Linux support to more distros and versions of Linux OS’s. Chromemote currently supports Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux (Ubuntu 12).&nbsp;Unfortunately ChromeOS is still not compatible with the plugin used by Chromemote to communicate with Google TVs.\n<br><br>\nChromemote uses a specially built NPAPI plugin and these sort of plugins are not supported by ChromeOS. We are actively working on an alternative solution that will allow ChromeOS. We are Chromebook users ourselves so we believe this is a really important feature to come in future updates.\n<br><br>\nWithin the last week we have made drastic updates to some of the inner programming of Chromemote, in order to insure that we will be able to continue to upload Chromemote updates to the Chrome Web Store.\n<br><br>\nGoogle is phasing out older Google Chrome extensions that have not been upgraded to the stricter manifest 2 specifications, so we updated and replaced everything in the guts of Chromemote that is being phased out.&nbsp;This has made Chromemote even more secure and will keep Chromemote from being removed from the Chrome Web Store as these older extensions are phased out by Google.\n<br><br>\nLastly we would like to say THANK YOU! to all of our Chromemote donors and supporters! Everybody that has reached out, made donations, and volunteered time and energy have made this all possible and give use the fuel to keep moving forward with our dreams. It has been a long journey through the process to launch our startup and it wouldn’t be possible without the tremendous support and love from the fans.<p></p>","live":true}

I have been dedicated to this vision for quite some time and spent extensive time developing workarounds to enable communication between Google Chrome and Google TV. Then my prayers and dreams were answered last week during Google IO 2012. Thanks to the amazing work of Googlers, Dave Fisher, Paul Saxman, and I am sure many others at Google, I have been able to make the dream of Chromemote a reality.</p><br><p>I have been using it for about a week now and I can’t live without it. I am continually working to improve the user experience and to roll out more features that expand on this unique way of interacting with Google TV. There is still a bit of work to complete as I layout the development roadmap for Chromemote. I couldn’t wait to share this experience with the world so I have submitted a working beta version for everyone brave enough to give it a try. I had hoped to make it available for the 4th of July holiday yesterday but my submission to the Chrome Web Store has been delayed. The delay is due to a special plugin that is required for the Google TV communication to work.</p><br><p>Any Google Chrome extension using this type of plugin is required to have the extension manually reviewed for security reasons. As soon as I am granted permission to publish Chromemote to the Chrome Web Store I will share it on Google Plus. The pairing process in the initial beta release isn’t pretty but once connected Chromemote works really well. I have been able to get the touchpad to work as well as full keyboard support. It is so cool using my computers keyboard and mouse on my Google TV. Sort of like a software KVM but you can see both screens and switch keyboard and mouse very easily. Also I have the ‘Fling’ feature working.</p><br><p>The fling button will instantly send your currently opened tabbed URL to open up on your TV. I am preparing full details about the beta version and instructions on how to use it. Check in on www.chromemote.com/beta for the latest details on the Chromemote beta. Thank you so much for the support from everybody out there that have helped me make this possible. I sincerely appreciate every bit of help and kindness from everyone that has pitched in to kick start Chromemote. I hope to continue to make Chromemote better everyday.</p>","live":true}

I had to apply for the program and go through an interview process. I was able to pitch my idea for Chromemote that I had been working on for several months prior to the event, and the interviewers really liked my idea. It wasn’t long before I was accepted to participate.</p><br><p>Almost everybody coming into the event had their own ideas to pitch, but we broke into teams and narrowed it down to just over ten ideas by the evening where we voted for the top five. I pitched my idea to everybody and after the vote count came out Chromemote made the top five. So then I was able to gather a team of developers and business minded people together to spend the rest of the weekend working on my idea. After telling everybody what I needed help with I had four people join my team. The Chromemote team, which was later renamed Mote consisted of developers Ankit Anchila, Eduardo Gerardo Mendizabal, business gurus Rad Elhage, Norris Kwan, and myself the wild-card.</p><br><p>Over the weekend my idea grew into a much larger and broader idea. Initially I was interested in building a highly customizable web-based Google TV remote application. After brainstorming the larger idea of Mote emerged, which is a startup dedicated to creating a universal smart tv remote control web-app. Despite many technical difficulties our team was able to put together a presentable prototype by the final presentation. Our team also got out of the building to focus on market validation. We talked to dozens of potential clients and used all the feedback to further our startup idea.</p><br><p style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http://www.chromemote.com/images/posts/tumblr_m7lpyxVTED1rsh8vzo1_1280.jpg\" width=\"230\" align=\"center\"></p><br><p>On the final day we presented our project to a panel of top-notch entrepreneurs and investors. The feedback and advice we received was priceless.
